								<h2> Problem statement </h2>
								<p> Due to a calamity / disaster the communication towers are failed and the people in this area is frustuated and are in need.</p>
								<h2>DRCM</h2>
								<p> Our project comes into play in the above situation as follows <br>
								small modules are placed in a cetain distance in the effected region . people in this region is now visible to a open wifi named "EMERGENCY" which they can connect using any devices . now a offline webpage is pushed to users browser usinf <i> captive portal</i> . Now the webpage contains a form which the users are requested to fill and submit .This data is transfered through lora communication to a server situated about 10km (depends up on the lora gateway range) . now this data is uploaded to cloud (ps : server has network connectio explosure )  </p>
								
								<h2>Disaster & communication managment</h2>
								<p> This project provides an alternative way of communication in case of a network failure . taking any disaster into consideration like <i> Flood , Cyclone etc </i> . anything that can disturb our normal way of Radio wave communication . our project creates a new way of communication using lora . whic uses chirp spread spectrum</p>
								<p> So we places small modules equiped with a <i> esp8266 and lora</i> onto poles above 6ft separated about 1km apart if there is no lora gateway in area . if there is a gateway existing the modules can be placed 2km-5km in radius of the gateway station <i>this depends on the range of the gateway </i>  </p>
								<p> When a user gets into the range of the <i>esp8266</i> which is a wifi module and this is configured to act a Hotspot in range of 500m radius . when a user connects to this wifi using any smart devices a portal containing a user form appears where the user is required to enter 
									their details <i>Name,Address,Contact</i> when the user submits the form the contents are sent over via a lora network <i>"this can be point2point or gateway base"</i> The form details are now recieved to a raspberry server running rasbian(any linux os is suitable but rasbian is prefred if you are new  </p>
								<p>PS: There is no cellular network available in is the user side but the data is transfered over a long distance(10km or above) and to the server where there is a network connection </p>
									<p> Now the a python script is made run to accept the data from lora via GPio pins and the data is sorted and uploaded to cloud . Google Firebased is used here to store the data . this is a free service provided by google firebase <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">click here for more details </a> finally a webpage gatheres the firebase data and sort it out in realtime to a table containing the user details i.e <i>"name , address, contact"</i>  </p>
